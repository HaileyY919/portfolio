<h2>About the Designer</h2>
<p>When I began my high school career, I had no clue what I wanted to do after I graduated. That’s when I took my first photography class, which then led to me taking another and also enrolling in graphic design courses. During these courses, my teacher set us up with opportunities to work with local businesses and provide them with logos, brochures, business cards, etc. These meetings helped me realize that graphic design was something I enjoyed and wanted to pursue.</p> 
<p>I am now enrolled in North Idaho College’s Graphic and Web Design program where I have been working towards an Associate of Applied Science. The program has been an amazing experience where I have been given the chance to learn more of what the Adobe programs have to offer, as well as learning what it takes to succeed in the industry. I have toured multiple graphic design and print facilities, and worked on a wide variety of projects to learn all sides of what graphic design has to offer.</p> 
<p>I have taken what I learned in my photography and graphic design classes with me into other areas of my life as well and used them to my creative advantage.</p>

    <p>During high school, my best friend created a bookclub. When she was getting it started I helped her out by creating bookmarks we could hand out to current memebers as well as spread the word of the club. I did not create the logo featured on the bookmarks because my friend was also creative, but I did want to create bookmarks that would look nice with the logo she created.</p>

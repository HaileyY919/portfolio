    <p>My dad owns his own business called Molecular Reptile where he breeds and sells snakes and other reptiles. For one of his reptile shows he wanted me to make him a poster he could put on his booth table. He wanted his logo to be in the center and have a few of his snake pictures featured in it. This poster is what I created. Later on, as my skills improved he asked me to make him a full sized banner. He wanted the banner to essentially be a larger version of the table-top poster.</p>

    <p>After creating these print marketing materials for Ryan, my father, I also convinced him that his website could use a little help, so I built him a new one. You can view the site <a href="https://haileyy919.github.io/MolecularReptile/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

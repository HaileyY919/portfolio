    <p>This project was one off of the 99 Designs website contests where I was able to filter what kind of project I wanted to do and then find an interesting design breif to follow. This one in particular was for a cleaning company that needed a logo. They wanted a logo utilizing the word only with limited graphical elements, and to use green and blue colors.</p>

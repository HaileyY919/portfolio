    <p>In my typography class I had to make another poster only using type. This poster I was able to use more than one typeface, unlike the Favorite Type one. I used Brush for the word design, Orange Squash for the word visual, and Archivo Black for the words in the brain and Saul Bass. The icons I used for the backgorund pattern were an icon font I found and made a pattern out of.</p>

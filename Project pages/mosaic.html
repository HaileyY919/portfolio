    <p>This photo mosaic was created using both Photoshop and Lightroom. In Lightroom I created a folder of 300 images and resized them all to 1 by 1 squares. Once I had resized them all, I exported the folder from Lightroom and imported it into Photoshop in a contact sheet, so I could make the photos into a pattern. From there, I overlayed the photos over one main image to make it look like my photo was made up of many little photos.</p>

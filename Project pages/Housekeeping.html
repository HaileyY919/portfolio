    <p>This housekeeping logo was inspired by one of my previous jobs where I worked as a housekeeper. I originally wanted to re-design my boss's logo but she was not interested. I decided to still do it as a fun project but not to have her name attached, but rather another name, Rachel. I wanted to incorporate elements that showed housekeeping so I made the H be the house and have the top of the R in Rachel be a spray bottle.</p>

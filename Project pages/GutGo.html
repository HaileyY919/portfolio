    <p>This project was one off of the 99 Designs website contests where I was able to filter what kind of project I wanted to do and then find an interesting design breif to follow. This one in particular was for a company called nooro that makes supplements as well as other products. I chose to base my design around similar product labels they have already but for their new one, GutGo! in order to be consistent with their branding.</p>

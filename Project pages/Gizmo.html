    <p>At North Idaho College I am the vice president of service in the Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society. During one of our projects, we partnered with Gizmo to hold an event for PTK members, students, and the general public. At this event we had activities for people to do where they got to take home something they made, as well as food and a give-away. To advertise the event, I created a flier to hang around campus and post on social media.</p>

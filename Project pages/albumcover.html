    <p>For this assignment, we were to choose one of our favorite songs and make an album cover to represent elements of the song. I chose 2Pac's Dear Mama and created both a static and annimated album cover. This was my first time creating an annimation and it was interesting doing so in Photoshop and learning that area of the software.</p>

    <p>In high school I had the opportunity as a junior to take the Idaho Science and Aerospace Scholars (ISAS) course. In this course we learned many things about space exploration. I was then granted the opportunity to join their summer academy following the class. In the academy, I spent a week with 40 other students from around the state of Idaho to plan a mission to Mars. We were split into teams and had to present our groups section at the end of the week. With the presentation also came a poster, which I took the liberty to create for my team since I had the tools to make it in Illustrator at the time rather than another program.</p>
    <p>Below is a Crew Exploration Vehicle sketch that I made for the ISAS Class.</p>

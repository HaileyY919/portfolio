    <p>This logo was the first assignment we were given in my Adobe Illustrator class. Our professor wanted us to create a hobby logo to get to know a bit more about us. I took the opportunity to create a skateboard. Although I am not an amazing skater, I still love it when I get the chance to ride. The most difficult part of making this logo, especially with minimal Adobe knowledge, was adding texture to the board.  </p>

    <p>This New Years Card I made out of only type. The font I chose is called Balloon Dreams. I wanted to have the essence of the design revolve around celebrations, so I wanted balloons and fireworks. I also turned the 0 into a clock striking midnight. For the back of this card I used my logo as the stamp.</p>

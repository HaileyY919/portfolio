    <p>At North Idaho College I was the vice president of service in the Phi Theta Kappa Honors Society. Mid spring semester the society holds and "induction ceremony" or member meeting, where we host a dinner and welcome in new members each year. To advertise the event, I created a flier to hang around campus and post on social media.</p>

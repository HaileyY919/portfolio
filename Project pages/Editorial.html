    <p>For one of my InDesign class assignments we were tasked with creating an Editorial Profile on one of our favorite artists. I chose to create mine for Benson Boone and include elements such as text wraps, imagry, and color to tie the whole thing together. I also wanted to keep it tied to his personal branding by using his logo of his name, and using the color pink from his "pulse" albumb.</p>

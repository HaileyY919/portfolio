    <p>Since I was learning Adobe programs while being a dual credit high school senior, I decided to make my own graduation announcements. I wanted at least two photos of myself as well as graduation elements (cap and diploma). Then I decided to go with a black and gold theme for the background and the important text.</p>
    <p>I also designed my friend, Regan and my boyfriend, Landonâ€˜s Graduation Cards.</p>

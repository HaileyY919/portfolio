    <p>I made this logo for my senior project. The senior project class I took was online through an entrepreneurship class. We did the project in a group to make it easier to divide up the workload of creating a business. Our business was called Pawtential. We were essentially a social media marketing agency for pet products. My group granted me the opportunity to create our logo after we decided on the name and color scheme.</p>

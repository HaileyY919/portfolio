    <p>This project logo was an experience to say the least. My teacher had us first draw out 99 pictogram images of whatever came to mind. Then we had to choose 9 of our favorite sketches to re-draw but larger. After drawing the 9, we had to pick 6, then combine those 6 into 3. With those 3 combined sketches, we got to pick our favorite that would be the final.</p> 
    <p>The final sketches I chose to combine were a magic hat and cards. I was lucky these two went together nicely to create essentially a magic logo. With that logo, I then got to create a fake business. Once I determined that my business would be a magic shop/theater, I was able to continue with the further areas of the assignment to create a business package.</p>

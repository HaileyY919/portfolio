    <p>In my user experience design class I was tasked with rebranding an already existing app for a new demographic. The app I chose is Jobber which is used for small businesses to manage their employees' schedules and jobs on any given day. The app I created from it I called Syncly which is a shared calendar app with your friend group so you can make plans easier. The goal for me in this project was to utilize the already existing functions of the calendar and map from Jobber and make them function for a social calendar app like Syncly. I also added functions such as a mini social media home page where friends could post things for the others to view, they can message in the app, and can customize their profiles and calendars. I mocked up the pages in the app and their functionality in Adobe XD.</p>

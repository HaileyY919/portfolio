    <p>This logo for Yard Raptor was one my web design class was tasked with creating for a website selling 3D printed raptor arms that you stick on the back of chickens. This was such a funny project and I enjoyed the creative freedom associated with this logo design. I wanted to go with something where the chicken element was the most obvious with the shadow of the raptor representing the raptor element and the yard element is also displayed through the fence texture of the text.</p>

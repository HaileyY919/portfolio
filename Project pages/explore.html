    <p>This magazine cover was one of my Photoshop class assignments where we essentially had free rain over what we made so long as we used the "explore" title with that font. We were allowed up to 5 instances of AI generated content and had to make something captivating and creative. My personal favorite part was making my Anglerfish look like it is lighting up the text above it and it fading out the further from the fish the text is.</p>

    <p>For another Adobe Illustrator assignment, we had to make a monogram of our initials. I always write my name in cursive, so I decided to have my initials in cursive for this too. It was hard to decide on what artistic route to take with this assignment, but I thought the best way would be to disguise my initials as flowers, more specifically tulips. My initials are HAY so I put the H and Y as flowers and the A is hidden below in the roots.</p>

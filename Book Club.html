    <p>The high school I went to does not have many clubs. My best friend decided to change that by creating a Book Club. She asked me to create a poster for her to hang around the school to advertise the club. I did not make the book club logo, but I used the logos coloring in the poster to keep the two elements cohesive.</p>
    <p>I also made some bookmarks that we handed out to club members.</p>

    <p>My dad owns his own business called Molecular Reptile where he breeds and sells snakes and other reptiles. For one of his reptile shows he wanted me to make him a poster he could put on his booth table. He wanted his logo to be in the center and have a few of his snake pictures featured in it. This poster is what I created. Later on, as my skills improved he asked me to make him a full sized banner. He wanted the banner to essentially be a larger version of the table-top poster.</p>

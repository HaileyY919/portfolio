    <p>Rosette Cookies are a type of cookie my grandma and I always make around Christmas. This tradition prompted me to make her a nice recipe page that we can use. I knew she would love this and when I gave it to her, she was super excited, so I am glad I took the time to do that for her. The boarder is made up of cookies, and the other elements I made are used in making the cookies.</p>
